# Modern C++ Features

This directory contains examples of modern C++ features introduced in C++11 and later. Each file demonstrates a specific feature or best practice for writing efficient, safe, and expressive C++ code.

## Contents
- **01_move_semantics_cpp11_aprofundado.cpp**: In-depth exploration of move semantics, move constructors, and move assignment operators for efficient resource management.
- **02_smart_pointers_aprofundado.cpp**: Advanced usage of smart pointers (`std::unique_ptr`, `std::shared_ptr`, `std::weak_ptr`) for automatic memory management and avoiding memory leaks.

These examples help you understand and apply modern C++ idioms in real-world code.
