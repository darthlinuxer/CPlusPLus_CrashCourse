# 01_Basic

This directory contains introductory C++ examples to help you get started with the language. It covers fundamental concepts such as basic syntax, variables, control flow, and type manipulation. Below is a summary of the examples included:

- **01_hello.cpp**: A simple "Hello World!" program to introduce basic syntax and console output.
- **02_variables.cpp**: Explains various data types in C++ including integers, floating-point numbers, characters, boolean types, and fixed-width integer types.
- **03_auto_example.cpp**: Demonstrates type inference using the `auto` keyword for automatic type deduction.
- **04_flow.cpp**: Explores control flow structures such as `if-else`, `switch`, loops (`for`, `while`, `do-while`), and the `goto` statement.
- **05_range_based_for_example.cpp**: Shows modern C++ range-based for loops for iterating over collections.
- **06_constexpr.cpp**: Demonstrates the use of `constexpr` for compile-time evaluation of values and functions.
- **07_nullptr_example.cpp**: Illustrates the `nullptr` keyword for null pointer handling in modern C++.
- **08_type_conversions.cpp**: Covers implicit and explicit type conversions, including `static_cast`, `const_cast`, `reinterpret_cast`, and `dynamic_cast`.
