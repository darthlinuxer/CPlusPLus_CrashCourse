# 01_Basic

This directory contains introductory C++ examples to help you get started with the language. It covers fundamental concepts such as control flow, data types, and compile-time evaluation. Below is a summary of the examples included:

- **constexpr.cpp**: Demonstrates the use of `constexpr` for compile-time evaluation, including functions like `square` and `factorial`.
- **flow.cpp**: Explores control flow structures such as `if-else`, `switch`, loops (`for`, `while`, `do-while`), and the `goto` statement.
- **hello.cpp**: A simple "Hello World!" program to introduce basic syntax and console output.
- **variables.cpp**: Explains various data types in C++ including integers, floating-point numbers, characters, and boolean types.
