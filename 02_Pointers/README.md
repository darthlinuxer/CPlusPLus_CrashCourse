# 02_Pointers

This directory contains examples related to pointers and memory management in C++:

- **01_null_pointers.cpp**: Demonstrates null pointer usage, proper checking, and comparing traditional pointer techniques with modern std::find.
- **02_out_and_ref_example.cpp**: Compares parameter passing by reference vs. by pointer, showing how to modify variables outside function scope through both methods.
- **03_pointers.cpp**: Comprehensive overview of pointers including basic pointers, null pointers, double pointers, dynamic memory allocation, and pointer types.
- **04_referenceVsPointers.cpp**: In-depth comparison between references and pointers, highlighting their differences and use cases.
- **05_pointers_advanced.cpp**: Covers advanced memory management techniques, RAII pattern, and copy/move semantics with raw pointers.
- **06_smartpointers.cpp**: Explains modern C++ smart pointers (`std::unique_ptr`, `std::shared_ptr`, and `std::weak_ptr`) for automatic and safe memory management.
