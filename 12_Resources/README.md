# Resources and RAII in C++

This directory demonstrates the RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) principle in C++:

- **File Handling**: Ensures proper resource cleanup using RAII.
- **Memory Management**: Demonstrates automatic cleanup of dynamically allocated memory.

### Parallels with C#
- RAII in C++ is similar to C#'s `using` statement for resource management.
