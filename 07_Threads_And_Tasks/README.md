# Threads and Tasks in C++

## Overview
This directory contains examples demonstrating the use of threads and tasks in C++. Threads and tasks are essential for concurrent programming, allowing programs to perform multiple operations simultaneously. Below is an explanation of the examples in this directory and a comparison of threads and tasks in C++.

---

## Code Examples

### 1. `threads_example.cpp`
This file demonstrates the use of threads in C++ for concurrent execution. It includes examples of:

- **Basic Thread Execution**: Creating and joining threads to execute a function.
- **Mutex Usage**: Using `std::mutex` to synchronize access to shared resources.
- **Condition Variables**: Using `std::condition_variable` to signal threads to proceed based on a shared state.

Key Concepts:
- Threads are created using `std::thread`.
- Synchronization is achieved using `std::mutex` and `std::condition_variable`.
- Threads must be joined or detached before the program ends.

### 2. `tasks_example.cpp`
This file demonstrates the use of tasks in C++ for asynchronous execution. It includes examples of:

- **Asynchronous Tasks**: Using `std::async` to launch tasks in separate threads.
- **Deferred Execution**: Using `std::launch::deferred` to delay task execution until the result is explicitly requested.

Key Concepts:
- Tasks are launched using `std::async`.
- Results of tasks are retrieved using `std::future`.
- Tasks can run asynchronously or be deferred based on the launch policy.

## Threads vs Tasks in C++

### Threads
- **Definition**: Threads are the basic unit of execution in C++ for concurrent programming.
- **Usage**: Use `std::thread` to create and manage threads.
- **Control**: The programmer has full control over thread creation, synchronization, and termination.
- **Synchronization**: Requires explicit use of synchronization primitives like `std::mutex` and `std::condition_variable`.
- **Overhead**: Threads have higher overhead due to manual management.

### Tasks
- **Definition**: Tasks represent units of work that can be executed asynchronously.
- **Usage**: Use `std::async` to launch tasks and `std::future` to retrieve results.
- **Control**: The runtime system manages task execution, making it easier to use.
- **Synchronization**: Results are automatically synchronized using `std::future`.
- **Overhead**: Tasks have lower overhead as the runtime handles execution details.

## Summary
- Use **threads** when you need fine-grained control over execution and synchronization.
- Use **tasks** when you want a simpler, higher-level abstraction for asynchronous operations.

Both threads and tasks are powerful tools for concurrent programming in C++, and the choice between them depends on the specific requirements of your application.
