# Visual Studio Project Structure

This project is a tutorial on C++ best practices. It demonstrates modern C++ features and techniques to help developers write clean, efficient, and maintainable code. Each folder in the project focuses on a specific topic, providing examples and explanations.

## Project Structure:
- **01_Basic:** Introduces basic C++ concepts like `constexpr` and simple programs.
- **02_Pointers:** Demonstrates the use of pointers and smart pointers for resource management.
- **03_Vectors:** Explains the use of `std::vector` for dynamic arrays.
- **04_Enums:** Covers strongly typed enumerations using `enum class`.
- **05_Functions:** Focuses on modern function features like `noexcept` and `constexpr` functions.
- **06_STL:** Explores Standard Template Library (STL) features like `std::optional`, `std::string`, and algorithms.
- **07_Resources:** Demonstrates RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) principles with examples like file handling and memory management.
- **08_Lambdas:** Examples of lambda expressions, including captures and usage in algorithms.
- **09_Templates:** Examples of template programming, including function templates and class templates.
- **10_Object_Oriented:** Examples of object-oriented programming, including inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.
