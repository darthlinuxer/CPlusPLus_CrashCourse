# Object-Oriented Programming in C++

This directory covers object-oriented programming concepts in C++:

- **Inheritance**: Demonstrates how classes can inherit from other classes.
- **Polymorphism**: Explains runtime polymorphism using virtual functions.
- **Encapsulation**: Shows how to restrict access to class members.

### Parallels with C#
- Object-oriented principles in C++ are similar to those in C#, with differences in syntax and implementation.
