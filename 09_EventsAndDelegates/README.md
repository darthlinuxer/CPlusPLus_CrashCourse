# Events and Delegates in C++

This directory explores event-driven programming in C++:

- **Custom Events**: Demonstrates how to create and handle custom events.
- **Delegates**: Explains the use of function pointers and `std::function` for callbacks.

### Parallels with C#
- Events and delegates in C++ are similar to C#'s event-driven programming model, but require more manual implementation.
